# Insights Summary

## Introduction
This report provides a clear, visual summary of insights derived from the customer risk analytics dataset.  
Each chart explains a different aspect of customer behavior from credit utilization to billing trends and risk segmentation.  
The goal is to make complex data understandable and useful for decision-making **without requiring deep technical or financial knowledge**.

# About the Data

The dataset contains information about customers’ account activity, including balance amounts, credit limits, payment behavior, and other related details.
Each entry represents one customer profile, showing how they use and manage their credit over time.

Several new columns were created through data processing to help visualize customer behavior such as utilization (the share of used credit), slope (the direction of balance change), and a composite risk score that combines multiple factors.

# Visual Insights 

## 1. `Distribution of Credit Utilization Among Customers`
*Shows how customers use their available credit limits.*

Most customers stay within moderate utilization levels, suggesting balanced financial behavior.  
However, a small group displays very high utilization, which may signal financial stress or overreliance on credit.  
A concentration around lower values indicates healthier credit management overall.

## 2. `Average Bill by Age Group`
*Compares average bill amounts across customer age groups.*

Younger customers tend to have smaller bills, while older groups show higher amounts.  
This difference may relate to income levels, lifestyle, or access to credit.  
Recognizing these trends helps tailor products or communication strategies by age segment.

## 3. `Billing Trend vs Utilization`
*Explores how changes in billing behavior align with credit utilization.*

Customers with **rising bills and high utilization** often fall into higher-risk zones,  
while those with stable or declining bills and moderate utilization typically remain lower risk.  
This chart visually links spending stability with financial reliability.

## 4. `Customer Segmentation by Risk Category`
*Groups customers by their overall risk level — Low, Medium, and High.*

This visualization highlights the proportion of customers in each risk tier.  
A strong presence of **low-risk** customers suggests a stable portfolio,  
whereas a visible number of **medium or high-risk** customers calls for closer review or early intervention.

## 5. `Customer Journey: Utilization → Risk`
*Illustrates how utilization levels translate into overall risk scores.*

As utilization increases, risk scores also tend to rise.  
This steady upward relationship emphasizes that high credit usage can be an early signal of financial strain.  
Responsible utilization remains one of the strongest indicators of financial stability.

## 6. `Utilization Distribution by Default Payment Next Month`
*Compares utilization patterns between customers who defaulted vs those who didn’t.*

Defaulting customers tend to use a larger portion of their credit limit.  
In contrast, customers who make timely payments generally maintain lower utilization.  
This clear visual separation confirms utilization as a reliable **predictor of potential defaults**.

## 7. `Avg Bill per Month by Risk Flag`
*Tracks average monthly bill amounts for different risk groups.*

High-risk customers show larger fluctuations and sometimes higher bills,  
while low-risk customers display steadier trends.  
This difference suggests that consistent billing habits are linked with lower financial risk.

## 8. `Composite Risk Score Distribution`
*Displays how customers are spread across the full range of risk scores.*

The color gradient visually transitions from **low to high risk**,  
showing that most customers fall within the safe zone, but a smaller cluster lies toward the high-risk end.  
This helps in identifying segments that need **targeted risk monitoring**.
